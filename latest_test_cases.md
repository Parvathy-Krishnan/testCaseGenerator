TEST CASE GENERATION:

```feature
Feature: Delete endpoints
 As a Q neue Menschen-API tester,
 In order to verify delete endpoints are properly implemented,
 I want to validate all delete endpoints and their responses.

 Scenario out lineageID Valid Delete
 given path '/people/{lineageID}'
 when methodDELETE
 entonces respuestacliente contains jsonValue " success Code" with membres PersonenAPI successfulDeleteMESSagen
 and statusCode successfulStatus
 Given path '/people/{line Familie ID}' withheaders autorizacionToken
 when methodDELETE with parameters lineageID
 then status Code failedDeleteMessage
 given path ' people/all'
 when methodGET
 thenmatch responsepeople Count peoplecountlessThanZERO
 givenpath 'people/search' with params searchQuery
 when methodget
 ent neue persons with filter searchQuery people Count less than Zero people SearchResultMESSagen when searchquery contains search text
 given path '/people/deleteall' with head err authorizaison token
 when method delete all
 then status Code should be successfulStatus
 given path ' people/ all ' with Headers authorization token 'bearer' Authorization type
 when method POST with Body delete all body
 entonces status Code should be failed delete all message
 given path ' people/ all ' with head bear token Authorization type authorization token
 when method DELETE all
 then status Code should be successful status message

 Scenario out lineageID Invalid Delete
 given path '/people/inexistentlineageid' with Headers authorizasion token ' bear' token
 when method DELETE with Body request body incomplete
 then status Code should be unauthorized access message
 given path ' people/lineageID with malformed ID ' with Headers authorizaison token ' bear' token
 when method DELETE with body request malformed
 then status Code should be bad request message
 given path '/people/lineageID with null ID' with Headers authorizaison token ' bear' token
 when method DELETE with body request empty
 then status Code should be bad request message
 given path ' people/ lineage ID with missing ID ' with Headers authorizaison token ' bear' token
 when method DELETE with body request null
 then status Code should be un processeeexception message

 Scenario out lineageID Delete without Headers
 given path ' people/lineageID '
 when method DELETE with body request complete
 then status Code should be un processed exception message
```

This feature file covers both positive and negative test cases for deleting people from the API, with tests for valid, invalid, and missing requests, as well as tests for handling unauthorized access and malformed requests. The `autorizacionToken` and `delete all body` variables need to be properly defined before executing the feature file.

===========================================

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- ensure every scenario tests a single requirement
- update feature and scenarios names with detailed test information
- handle possible API rate limiting by controlling test frequency and introducing sleep times as needed
- incorporate necessary data pre generation, test case specific data, and data clean up as required
- provide detailed test reports after test execution with a summary of results, failure analysis, and follow up actions

===========================================

In this Karate feature file, we generate comprehensive tests for deleting people from the API. We cover various positive and negative scenarios including valid deletions, failure response checks, improper formatted requests, un authorized access, and testing the delete all people end point.

## Validation Report

### ‚ùå Errors Found:
- Background section is recommended
- At least one scenario is required
- When steps are required
- Then steps are required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings:
- Limited use of Karate DSL patterns detected

### üí° Suggestions for Improvement:
- Consider using variable definitions with '* def' for better test maintenance
- Consider adding debug prints for better test debugging
